=======

This repo is source code of my personal website [lcfcn.com](http://www.lcfcn.com)

It's powered by Django and using markdown as makeup language

My code is licensed under [MIT License](http://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/)

I'm a green hand in python&django and not programming-educated,     
I learned everything about python&django from offical documents.    
So my code has no guarentee on security and efficiency and    
anything else.

If you will review this repo and give me any advice -- you are welcome, 

If you want to use my code somewhere -- be carful.
